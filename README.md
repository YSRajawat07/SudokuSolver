# SudokuSolver

1. This interactive GUI application brings Sudoku puzzles to life by incorporating a real-time visualization of the backtracking
algorithm.
2. Notable features include puzzle generation at different difficulty levels, solution highlighting and error detection. The
backtracking solver ensures accurate solutions while the visual representation transforms solving into an engaging experience.
3. NumPy python library is used to create and work with sudoku grids, which are 2d arrays or matrices.
4. Sudoku is a NP complete problem, so it uses backtracking, working through every possible valid combination until it reaches the
end of the puzzle.
5. GUI for the project is done using pygame which is a python library used to create video games.
